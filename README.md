## Harvest Flow x Blast = An innovative solution to RWA lending
The Blast-native element of Harvest Flow utilizes Blast's yield generation feature to efficiently bridge the finance gap, enhancing returns for lenders and borrowers. Typically, lending platforms have unused funds that remain idle due to the difference of financial terms between individual lenders and corporate borrowers. Our approach leverages these funds through Blast's protocols, ensuring they generate yield, making 100% utilization of funds possible. This strategy improves capital efficiency, offering higher returns to lenders and more favorable rates to borrowers, directly addressing the inefficiencies of traditional lending by actively using all available resources.

## How Harvest Flow differ from other projects?
Harvest Flow stands out in the DeFi space by combining Real World Assets (RWA) with NFT technology, a novel approach that brings tangible assets into the digital lending realm. This integration ensures that lending has a tangible impact in the real world, extending beyond digital transactions to facilitate meaningful contributions to society. What sets us apart further is our remarkably low default rate of less than 1%, in stark contrast to other RWA DeFi platforms like Centrifuge and Goldfinch, which have default rates around 5%. This achievement is a testament to our rigorous asset selection and risk assessment processes. Additionally, our lending experience transcends mere numbers by incorporating real assets, thanks to our innovative approach of embedding IoT devices into each asset financed through our platform. This allows lenders and borrowers to track and manage assets with unprecedented transparency and efficiency, ensuring that every loan is not just a transaction, but a step towards a better world.
